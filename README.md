# Rewards For Plastic

Selected Problem: How do we increase the rate of plastic recycling from items bought at Supermarkets?

Solution: Track the amount of plastic a person buys in grocery stores and give points for weekly decrease in plastic consumption. These points may be exchanged for discounts or eligibility for lucky draws.

Extensions:
- Bring back to the supermarket to see how much recyclable plastic you recycle
- Build an AI to detect:
    - if the plastic can be recyclable
    - if the plastic is contaminated? Remind users to wash it first
